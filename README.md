# password-generator
This is an application for a responsive password generator. For this application, I was required to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. The interface is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## General info.
Upon accessing the applcation, the user is prompted to input how many characters long they want their password to be. The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long. The user is then presented with a number of prompts asking them if they would like uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and special characters. The user responds to each prompt by clicking 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no. Once all prompts have been answered, the password displays to the designated window below "Generate Password".
